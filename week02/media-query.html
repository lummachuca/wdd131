      <h2>Ether 3:19</h2>
      <p>And because of the knowledge of this man he could not be kept from beholding within the veil; and he saw the
        finger of Jesus, which, when he saw, he fell with fear; for he knew that it was the finger of the Lord; and he
        had faith
        no longer, for he knew, nothing doubting.</p>

      <h2>Ether 5:4</h2>
      <p>And in the mouth of three witnesses shall these things be established; and the testimony of three, and this
        work, in the which shall be shown forth the power of God and also his word, of which the Father, and the Son,
        and the Holy
        Ghost bear recordâ€”and all this shall stand as a testimony against the world at the last day.
